## Project Description
This project is about a studio management system. Most studios are conducting their management tasks manually. Therefore we hope to introduce this system to automate customer management, order management, payment handling, and printing report tasks that are happening in a studio. We are creating this under four parts,

●Professional customer management  
●	Amateur order management  
●	Professional order management  
●	Event order management. 

Mainly this system will be used by the studio staff. We have identified two types of customers as Professional Customers and Amateur Customers. Professional Customers are pre-registered in the studio management system. Amateur customers are daily customers. Orders are classified into two based on the customer types as Professional Orders and Amateur Orders. The other type of order is the Event Orders which is related to special occasions such as weddings and birthdays. Each of these will be associated with a payment handler function and a report generation in addition to the basic CRUD operations.
